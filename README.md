 There are 9 possible quiz outcomes.\
 For each question, there are 9 answer options that correspond directly to a related outcome.\
 To begin with, each user will be assigned a score of [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\
 The questions and answers are stored in arrays in JavaScript, each answer is assigned a corresponding value using a separate array.\
 After each submitted response, the user's score will be updated using assigned values.\
 At the end, the outcome with the highest corresponding score decides which result gets shown to the user.\
 N.B. If the top score is equal between two or more outcome options, the result served is the top scoring outcome that appears in the array first.
